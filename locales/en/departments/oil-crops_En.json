  "Given the high strategic importance of oil crops, and in line with the political leadershipâ€™s vision and the Agriculture 2030 strategy to expand the cultivated area of oil crops in order to reduce the gap between production and consumption and lower the import bill, a comprehensive plan has been developed for the Oil Crops Research Department, based on the following pillars:",
  "First: Expanding the breeding of new varieties and hybrids of oil crops that are high-yielding, resistant to diseases and insects, adaptable to different climatic conditions, and tolerant to salinity and drought, in order to cover the targeted expansion areas, especially in newly established national projects.",
  "Second: Providing breeder and foundation seeds of the developed varieties to seed production entities to ensure the availability of certified seeds of different oil crops.",
  "Third: Reviewing and updating extension bulletins and technical recommendations for each crop, and offering technical, practical, and scientific support to farmers across the country."
