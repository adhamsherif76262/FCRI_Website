  "Since its establishment, the Maize Research Department has spared no effort in its continuous and diligent work, striving to achieve self-sufficiency in maize, which is the main crop used in the production of feed for livestock, poultry, and fish.",
  "From its inception until now, the Maize Research Department has developed 132 varieties and hybrids of white and yellow maize, sweet corn, and popcorn.",
  "Maize is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, ranking third after wheat and rice. It is also the number one grain crop in terms of global trade. In 2024, global maize production reached 1,271 million tons, with a market value of 370 billion USD.",
  "Beyond being a staple food source in developing countries, maize plays a vital role in many industries: animal feed for poultry, cattle, and fish; starch and oil production; biofuel production; and certain pharmaceutical industries.",
  "The department continues to develop high-yielding maize hybrids that are resilient to climate change and suitable for multiple uses. This aims to increase crop productivity, narrow the gap between production and consumption, and develop specialty hybrids such as sweet corn and popcorn, ultimately increasing farmers’ income."
