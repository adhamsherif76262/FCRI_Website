  "Maize is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide, ranking third after wheat and rice. It holds first place globally in grain trade, with global maize production in 2024 reaching 1,271 million tons.",
  "Maize has diverse uses beyond being a staple food, especially in developing countries. It is a primary ingredient in animal, poultry, and fish feed, and it plays a key role in industries such as starch and oil production, as well as biofuel manufacturing.",
  "The Maize Research Department works on breeding new high-yield hybrids adapted to climate change, with the aim of increasing productivity and bridging the wide gap between production and consumption."

"P2": [
  "The Maize Research Department is considered one of the most important and largest departments affiliated with the Field Crops Research Institute at the Agricultural Research Center."
