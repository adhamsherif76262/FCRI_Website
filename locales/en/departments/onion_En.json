  "Onion is one of the most important crops with nutritional, medicinal, and economic value at both the local and international levels.",
  "Egypt ranks among the top ten countries worldwide in onion production and export, thanks to continuous efforts in breeding, improving, and developing onion varieties that meet the requirements of both local markets and export.",
  "This is achieved through the collection of genetic resources of onion varieties, the introduction of foreign imports, and the establishment of breeding programs to produce high-yield varieties with superior quality, storability, and resistance to diseases and climate change.",
  "Additionally, suitable agricultural practices are identified and transferred to stakeholders and those involved in onion cultivation."
