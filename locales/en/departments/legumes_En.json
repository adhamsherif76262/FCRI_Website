    "The Legume Crops Department is one of the most important departments within the Field Crops Research Institute, as it includes crops that are vital for the Egyptian people. Legumes are an essential part of a healthy diet, being rich in protein, fiber, oil, and other essential nutrients. They also contain high levels of iron and zinc.",
    "Legumes can also be integrated into intercropping systems or cultivated as cover crops to enhance soil fertility, reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers through nitrogen fixation, and improve phosphorus uptake. This contributes to a more sustainable production system. Examples include faba bean and soybean. The department works on developing and breeding new varieties that adapt to climate change and meet the requirements of both the Egyptian and global markets.",
    "Our varieties have achieved advanced global rankings in average yield per feddan, such as soybean, which ranks third worldwide in average yield per feddan."
